## Restructuring CRMM

This is a plan to rebuild [CRMM](https://github.com/CRModders/cosmic-mod-manager) project with a better code structure so that it doesn't become impossible to maintain. In the current version i've writeen a lot if not most of spaghetti code with kinda poor file structure too. I'll be just copy pasting most of the code as it is but with some refactorings and better file structure.

- Each significant directory contains a `NOTES.md` file that roughly describes what that direcory and each of its files/folders are meant for.
